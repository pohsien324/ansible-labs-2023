## Solution
This example program has no errors in the code, but there is a logical error. Please use the `--step` flag to check the error step by step.

1. The `backup_files` variable set in backup.yml has a higher priority than the inventory variable, so it overrides user settings. Please remove the `backup_files` variable from backup.yml.
